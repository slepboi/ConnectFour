🛠 **What does this project do?** ✅    
As seen by the title, it mimics the famous game "Connect 4." In this program,  
you are able to play against two people locally; it runs a loop that will end up  
assigning names to two different players and printing the board after every turn.  

🤔 **Why did I make it?** 💭  
This project encapsulates and showcases the knowledge I obtained this year; it  
utilizes multiple classes with efficient uses of inheritance and 2-D arrays. Also,  
it was used as a submission for my AP Computer Science A final.  

⚙ **How to use the project?** 🔧  
This project was designed for use in the CodeHS Sandbox.  
Download the file and upload it to the sandbox located in CodeHS.  

  ⚠ **BEWARE** ⚠   
Use of non-mentioned, third-party programs may result in  
errors and require altering of code.
