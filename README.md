### 🛠 **What does this project do?** ✅    
As seen by the title, it mimics the famous game "Connect 4." In this program,  
you are able to play against two people locally; it runs a loop that will end up  
assigning names to two different players and printing the board after every turn.  

### 🤔 **Why did I make it?** 💭  
This project encapsulates and showcases the knowledge I obtained this year; it  
utilizes multiple classes with efficient uses of inheritance and 2-D arrays. Also,  
it was used as a submission for my AP Computer Science A final.  

###  **Features**  
  
- The board functions as a 2D array that can be easily updated.
- The `Player` superclass splits into `RedPlayer` and `YellowPlayer` for clear role distinction.
- Getter and Setter methods simplify data access across classes.
  
### **Classes** 
`Game` - Runs a loop that stays on until the user decides to end the game  
`UI` - Maintains all forms of user input  
`State` - Manages the status of the game  
`Constants` - Holds all the constant (finalized) variables for easy use  
`Player` - A superclass that extends into two separate subclasses to determine the two players
